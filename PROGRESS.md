# AGENTGUARD - Progress Tracker

## Last Updated: May 17, 2026 - MVP COMPLETE

## Current Status: GREEN - MVP Built & Tested

## What's Done (MVP - Complete)
- [x] Project planning, memory files, architecture decisions
- [x] Git repo initialized (user: Rizwantahreem, email: tahreem.1701203@gmail.com)
- [x] **Backend (FastAPI)** - fully working:
  - [x] FastAPI server with CORS, health check
  - [x] SQLAlchemy models: AgentSession, ConversationLog, SecurityEvent, Policy
  - [x] Gemini API integration (gemini-2.0-flash) with mock fallback
  - [x] Lobster Trap policy engine (8 default policies: injection, PII, SQL, shell commands)
  - [x] All API endpoints: /agents/execute, /sessions, /security/events, /audit/logs, /metrics/dashboard, /policies, /tester/run
  - [x] SSE real-time event stream (/api/metrics/stream)
  - [x] Cost tracking service
  - [x] Adversarial test runner (27 test prompts across 4 categories)
  - [x] Dockerfile for deployment
- [x] **Frontend (Next.js 14)** - builds successfully:
  - [x] App router with route group layout (sidebar + main)
  - [x] Dashboard page: 6 metric cards, activity feed (SSE), security events, violation chart
  - [x] Agent Console: 3 agents, chat interface, blocked/safe indicators, violation badges
  - [x] Security Events page: filterable by severity, expandable details, auto-refresh
  - [x] Audit Logs page: searchable, blocked-only filter, expandable with violations
  - [x] Agent Tester (Red Team): agent selector, category filters, score circle, results table
- [x] **Integration tested**: 
  - Safe prompts pass through
  - Prompt injection BLOCKED (1 violation)
  - PII (email + SSN) BLOCKED (2 violations)
  - Security events captured
  - Audit logs captured
  - 8 policies auto-seeded

## What's Remaining (Day 2 - May 18)

### HIGH PRIORITY - Must Do
- [ ] **Add Gemini API key** to backend/.env (`GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key`)
  - Get from: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
- [ ] **Deploy backend to Render** (free tier, no card):
  1. Push to GitHub first
  2. Go to render.com → New Web Service → Connect GitHub repo
  3. Root directory: `backend`
  4. Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  5. Start command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
  6. Add env var: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app`
- [ ] **Deploy frontend to Vercel**:
  1. Go to vercel.com → Import → GitHub repo
  2. Root directory: `frontend`
  3. Add env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com`
- [ ] **Test production end-to-end**
- [ ] **Update CORS** in backend/app/main.py with actual Vercel URL

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Should Do
- [ ] Landing/hero page (currently redirects straight to dashboard)
- [ ] Run 3 demo scenarios and record for video
- [ ] Polish any UI issues found during testing
- [ ] Add favicon and meta tags
- [ ] Create GitHub repo on Rizwantahreem account and push

### LOW PRIORITY - Nice to Have
- [ ] Record <5 min demo video
- [ ] Create pitch deck (10 slides)
- [ ] Blog post draft
- [ ] Mobile responsive fixes
- [ ] Dark mode toggle (currently always dark)

## How to Run Locally

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create .env with GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key (optional - mock mode works without it)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 7860
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Key Files Reference
- `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` - Full architecture, API docs, tech decisions
- `backend/app/main.py` - FastAPI entry point
- `backend/app/services/lobster_trap.py` - Policy engine (all 8 default policies here)
- `backend/app/services/gemini.py` - Gemini integration + agent system prompts
- `backend/app/routers/agents.py` - Agent execution with full policy enforcement
- `backend/app/routers/metrics.py` - Dashboard metrics + test runner
- `backend/app/data/test_prompts.py` - All 27 adversarial test prompts
- `frontend/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Main dashboard
- `frontend/app/(app)/tester/page.tsx` - Red team tester (hero demo feature)
- `frontend/lib/api.ts` - API client + SSE stream
- `frontend/lib/types.ts` - All TypeScript types

## Notes for Teammate
1. The backend works in "mock mode" without a Gemini API key - agents return canned responses
2. With a Gemini API key, agents give real AI responses through the policy engine
3. The test runner (`/tester`) is the most impressive demo feature - run it first
4. SSE real-time updates work when frontend and backend are both running
5. SQLite DB is auto-created on first startup (agentguard.db in backend/)
6. To reset data, just delete agentguard.db and restart
